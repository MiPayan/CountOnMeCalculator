<br /> • The application design has not been finalized in the Xcode project: nothing is responsive.
<br /> • The project architecture does not yet follow good development practices (no MVC).
<br /> • The entire application is not tested.
<br /> • Only subtraction and addition were done, division and multiplication are missing.

<b>Design and graphic interface</b>
<br />

App appearance has been updated. The screen drops the blue to the gray which is more united with the rest of the calculator. The buttons have taken a rounded shape and colors of them were been conserved.
